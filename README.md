Superhero Mad Libs

In the terminal, run the following commands:

Then:
5) copy the URL into a web browser and hit enter

This is a not for profit project to showcase my skill in JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.  

How this mad lib website works:

A superhero is chosen at random initially.  The hero's name, picture, and biography are displayed with some words randomly removed from the text of the description.  The text that is removed is a word longer than 3 letters, or if the random word in question is a noun, verb, adverb, or adjective when the dictionary API doens't refuse requests.  The free dictionary API being used is  https://dictionaryapi.dev/.  The user can input their choice of words into the randomly chosen input fields within the superhero bio.

Images and bios are refrenced from Wikipedia.  I do not own the rights to the names of the superheros, images or superhero biography text used in the JSON file. Please see the following for more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#:~:text=The%20text%20of%20Wikipedia%20is,one%20or%20several%20liberal%20licenses.


The images, bios, and superhero names are from the following pages:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(character)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_(Marvel_Comics)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(character)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops_(Marvel_Comics)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(character)

Other images such as the background image, besides the pictures of each superhero which are from Wikipedia, are from https://www.craiyon.com.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
------------------
React router and Json server are installed.
