How this mad lib wepsite works:

A hero is chosen at random initially.
Their name, picture, and biography are displayed with some words are randomly removed from the text of the description.
The user inputs a new word into the fields.

The images, bios, and superhero names are from the following pages:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(character)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_(Marvel_Comics)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
------------------
React router and Json server are installed.
